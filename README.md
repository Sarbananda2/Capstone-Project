## Introduction

This application provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt messages. It combines multiple encryption techniques to enhance the security of your data. The encryption process involves the following ciphers:

- Vernam Cipher: A one-time pad encryption technique.
- Feistel Cipher: A symmetric key block cipher based on multiple rounds of encryption.
- AES Cipher: A widely-used block cipher known for its security.

## Features

- Encryption using Vernam Cipher, Feistel Cipher, and AES Cipher.
- Decryption using Vernam Cipher, Feistel Cipher, and AES Cipher.
- User-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption-app.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip.
```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application.
```bash
Copy code
python main.py
```

## Usage
## Encryption
Enter the plaintext message you want to encrypt.

Enter a key for Vernam Cipher, Feistel Cipher, and AES Cipher.

Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the ciphertext.

## Decryption
Enter the ciphertext you want to decrypt.

Enter the same keys used for encryption in the corresponding ciphers.

Click the "Decrypt" button to retrieve the original plaintext.
